<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p><p>
	<strong style="text-align: left; ">1. A visitor attends your worship service.</strong></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left; ">
	<strong>2. The Church points visitors to the Visitorr APP at the churches unique Visitorr URL (ie. <a href="http://www.visitorr.com/YOURCHURCHNAME"><span class="s1">www.visitorr.com/YOURCHURCHNAME</span></a>) using an announcement, bulletin, slide or personal interaction.</strong></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: left; ">
	<strong>3. Using their smart phone, or a computer supplied by the church the visitor types in their name and email address in to the quick and simple Visitorr APP<br />
	<br />
	4.&nbsp;That&#39;s it!&nbsp;On Monday morning the sunday visitor will receive a fully customized email and video from church leadership &nbsp;inviting and instructing the Sunday visitor on how to become involved in the church. Using links, email addresses and videos the church can now reach into the living rooms, offices, and homes of their Sunday visitors.</strong></p>
